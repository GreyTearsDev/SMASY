School Management System

This is a collection of small Python projects that will eventually (hopefully) provide me the knowledge to create a simple application to help me manage my chores at my current job (as a teacher). 
I am trying to create the habit of creating small projects with the concepts I learn.

These are the current files and their descriptions:

1- add-student - Allows the user to manually add and remove students from lists. 

2- list-sorter - Allows the user to randomly distribute students into 3 different classes of relatively the same size using data from a list. 
    * possible improvements for the future *
    a) allow the input data to be extracted form an external ".txt" file
    b) allow for saving the final result into an external ".txt" file

3- end-message.py - Allows the user to input text and saves it as a ".txt" file if the user decides to do so.

4- stock-manager - Allows the user to add and remove items in a dictionary.
